  description: |
    ScanAPI is a library for your API that provides automated integration
     testing and automated live documentation. Given an API specification
     written in YAML/JSON format, ScanAPI hits the specified endpoints, runs
     the test cases, and generates a detailed report of this executionâ€”which
     can also be used as the API documentation itself. With almost no Python
     knowledge, the user can define endpoints to be hit, the expected behavior
     for each response and will receive a full real-time diagnostic report of
     the API.
